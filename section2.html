        Project Summary:
        <br>
The result of conducting this study will be that we have a stronger grasp on the merits of education funding. Our research aims to uncover a link or lack thereof between changes in funding of public education and what careers students choose. There are three specific objectives of this study. First, create a useful dataset describing career choice and the amount spent on their education. Second, establish a method for isolating funding as a variable in vocational choice outcomes. Lastly, investigate and critique the current research cited when creating relevant policy. We will accomplish this by surveying multiple the graduates of several regions from specific school districts.
<br><br>Intellectual Benefits:<br>
There are mountains of research to be done on education. This research aims to provide a new puzzle piece that when slotted in will allow us to build off it and work towards a perfect education system. Our conclusions will help future researchers conduct their research. Being able to directly model a descriptive dataset showing the effect of funding on education will let us target issues surrounding educational outcome disparities. This allows us to further isolate them as variables that can be addressed independently.
<br><br>Practical/Policy benefits:<br>
Depending on the results of the study pertaining to whether there is or is not a link between education funding and vocational outcomes, this study could have a large impact on policy. Politicians can aim to adjust what careers their schools’ output and control the economy in a completely new way. Even the data does not uncover a link, it will be helpful in thwarting bunk policy justification that promises to increase the number of high paying jobs by increasing education funding.
<br><br>Literature Review:<br>
There is a broad body of work centered around the connections between education and careers. The two topics are connected in an easy to see linear way, since education, especially higher education opens different career opportunities. Before we investigate the connection between education funding and career choice, there are several bodies of research it will help to be familiar with. We will look at the topic of the effect of increased funding on education, which is always politicized and difficult to be certain of. Most of this research does not focus on vocational outcomes, but it is valuable to see the factors in education that are affected by changes in funding. We will also look at literature on the factors that impact career choice. These factors are often socioeconomic and cultural, which will make investigating their ties to educational funding very important to our key question.
<br>
The field of geography doesn’t have as closely related work as the other two but cannot be ignored as the spatial understanding gleaned from subfields like geographies of economies is very important in predicting vocational outcomes. If you grew up near Silicon Valley, you would have a higher propensity to work in the field of technology than if you grew up in the Rust Belt. This is largely due to job availability and the field’s local prevalence. The field of geography’s perspective on globalization can even be considered here as advances in technology and networked international corporations affects demand for different types of workers and in turn the availability of careers. The field of geography is very relevant here because the impact of funding on career choice might vary greatly across areas, and it will be important to make sure we aren’t painting with too large of a spatial brush and erasing all nuance. One study looked at the racism that exists in the de facto segregated schools in Detroit. There are simply lower quality education opportunities provided when compared to nearby suburban schools where they have mostly white students. This spatial analysis and examining of racial geographies is helpful when considering the way that money impacts the education and livelihoods of students and the adults that come from these broken school systems. Sometimes school districts are drawn so that funds are prevented from reaching communities that very much need them. 
<br>
Taking into consideration all these fields’ perspectives on vocational development, there still exists a gap where our question lies. While we have a somewhat thorough understanding of the drives that can influence a person’s career choice, we don’t have a model to see how those drives are affected by the funding of their education and the resources available to them. While there is a massive body of work to understand how funding of schools affects the quality of education, going as far as to examine different methods of applying increased funding, we lack a model that can predict how that funding impacts vocational outcomes. 
<br>
The bridging of these concepts to create a model that can describe the average amount spent on the education of various careers will be invaluable both for politicians crafting policy and schools aiming to create better curriculums. While there will always be other factors at work besides funding, it seems there is a gap in when it comes to understanding this pillar of career choice
